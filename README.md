# Identification of Spam email
Identification of spam email 


Hey Everyone!! We hope you are excited to apply and test your newly acquired knowledge in this notebook. In this assignment, we will be walking through creating an email classifier based on the content the mail has.

### About the data  

The data "email.csv" has a few rows and about 3K columns, including Email_no. and spam.
Email_no. is like a unique id for an email and spam denotes whether the given mail is spam or not (0 = not spam, 1 = spam)
The rest of the columns are English words with values equal to the frequency of that word in the email.
Our goal is to predict whether the given mail is spam or not.
